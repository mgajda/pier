synopsis: Yet another Haskell build system.
description: |
    Pier is a command-line tool for building Haskell projects.  It is
    similar in purpose to <https://www.haskellstack.org Stack>,
    but explores a different design:

    * Pier implements the fine-grained Haskell build logic from (nearly)
      scratch.  In contrast, Stack relies on Cabal to implement most of its
      build steps, giving it a more coarse control over the build.
    * Pier uses general-purpose libraries for implementing build systems, namely
      <https://shakebuild.com Shake> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pier-core pier-core>.

    For more information, see the official <https://github.com/judah/pier/blob/master/Readme.md documentation>.
